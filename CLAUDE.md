# SloperPro (Revit26_Plugin) — Development Standard

Revit 2026 add-in, .NET 8 / WPF. These rules apply to every change, by people and by Claude.

## Build

```bash
dotnet build Revit26_Plugin.csproj -p:EnableWindowsTargeting=true
```

Builds on Linux too (Revit API comes from the `Autodesk.Revit.SDK` NuGet package). A change is not
done until it builds with 0 errors. Running it still needs Revit on Windows.

## Repository conventions

- **Git is the version history.** Never copy a tool folder to make a new version (`Tool_V005` next to
  `Tool_V004`), and never commit `.zip` backups. Change the tool in place and bump its version.
- **Tool versions** live in `Shared/Services/ToolCatalog.cs` (one entry per tool, semantic version).
  The ribbon tooltip, window title and error dialogs read from it. A new tool gets a new entry there.
- **Plugin version** is `<Version>` in `Revit26_Plugin.csproj`.
- **Ribbon** files are in `Menu/00_Push_Button_Menu_items/Ribbon`. One button runs one tool; use a
  dropdown only to group different tools. Labels show the tool name, never a version number.
  Tooltips use `ToolCatalog.<Tool>.Tip(...)`.
- **Dropdown version order:** when a pulldown lists coexisting versions of the same tool (via
  `RibbonLayoutHelper.CreatePulldownButtonData` / `WirePulldownButton`), order them highest version
  number first, every older version below it in descending order — never "current version first".
  The highest version is also the one that supplies the pulldown button's own icon (the `primary`
  argument to `CreatePulldownButtonData`).
- **Entry points:** every `IExternalCommand.Execute` and `IExternalEventHandler.Execute` delegates to
  `ToolGuard.RunCommand` / `ToolGuard.RunHandler` (see any existing command). New ones must too.

## Robustness

1. No exception may reach Revit unhandled. `ToolGuard` is the last line of defence; still catch and
   handle expected failures where they happen, with a clear message.
2. Make model changes inside `using` `Transaction` / `TransactionGroup` blocks so failures roll back.
   Never commit partial work after an error.
3. Validate inputs before acting: null elements, missing parameters, wrong view type, read-only or
   workshared elements.
4. Handle edge cases: linked models, groups, in-place families, elements owned by other users (ACC /
   worksharing — check `WorksharingUtils.GetCheckoutStatus`).
5. Report errors in the tool's UI or log; never fail silently. Unexpected errors go to
   `%AppData%\Revit26_Plugin\Logs` through `ToolGuard.Report`.

## Documentation

1. Add `///` XML comments to all public classes and methods you add or change.
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` for every user-visible change (version, date, Added / Changed / Fixed /
   Removed, and a user note for any behaviour change).
3. Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH): MAJOR for breaking changes or removals, MINOR for
   new features, PATCH for fixes. Bump the tool in `ToolCatalog.cs` and the plugin in the `.csproj`.

## Backward compatibility

1. Never change a ribbon button's internal name (first `PushButtonData` argument), an
   `IExternalCommand` class name or namespace, or an add-in GUID. Change a visible label only when
   asked.
2. Never rename or remove shared parameters, parameter GUIDs or schema fields. Create new ones only if
   missing, and keep working without them.
3. Add a version field to JSON / Excel / config formats; read old and new, or migrate automatically.
4. Never change an existing Extensible Storage schema GUID or its fields; create a new schema version
   and migrate.
5. New options default to the old behaviour.
6. Keep export column names and order unchanged; append new columns at the end.
7. Keep Revit-version-specific API calls behind one helper so 2026 vs 2027 differences stay isolated.
8. Deprecate before deleting: keep the old behaviour for one or two releases with a warning, then
   remove.

## Pre-release checklist

1. Test on a model processed with the previous plugin version.
2. Run the old workflow end to end and compare outputs.
3. Confirm old settings and config files still load.
4. Update `CHANGELOG.md` and the version numbers.
