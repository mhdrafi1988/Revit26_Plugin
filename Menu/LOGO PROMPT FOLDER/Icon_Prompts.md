# AI Image-Generation Prompts — Ribbon Tool Icons

One monochrome icon prompt per live `PushButton` in the ribbon, after the cleanup pass that removed dead entries and added missing ones. Generated from the state of `Menu/00_Push_Button_Menu_items/Ribbon/*.cs` + `QuickAcces.cs` as wired up in `App.cs`.

## Shared style brief (prepend to every prompt)

> Flat monochrome line-art icon for a Revit ribbon toolbar button, single dark-gray/black stroke (#2B2B2B) on a fully transparent background, 32x32px canvas, simple geometric silhouette, no gradients, no shadows, no text or letters, no color, centered composition with even padding, consistent 2px stroke weight, matches the visual weight of Autodesk Revit's native ribbon icon set.

Each entry below is: **Button ID** → suggested filename (32px PNG, matches the project's `<Name>_32.png` convention) → subject-only prompt (append to the shared style brief above).

Several tool families already have an unused, never-wired icon sitting in `Resources/Icons/` (see `Ribbon_Code_Notes.md` §1) — those are flagged with "♻ reuse/refresh" so the same file can be regenerated instead of adding a new asset.
