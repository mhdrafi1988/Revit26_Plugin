// NEW, per Rafi's confirmed progress-bar/Cancel decision (ported from V010).
// A plain, UI-agnostic progress snapshot for ONE roof's run, reported via
// AutoSlopeDrainPayload.Progress at phase boundaries and, throttled, during
// DijkstraPathEngine.BuildGraph (the actual O(n^2) bottleneck on a large
// roof). Core/Engine and Core/Services never reference WPF — the ViewModel
// is what turns this into an on-screen percentage + phase label and pumps
// the UI so it actually repaints mid-run (see UiPumpHelper).
