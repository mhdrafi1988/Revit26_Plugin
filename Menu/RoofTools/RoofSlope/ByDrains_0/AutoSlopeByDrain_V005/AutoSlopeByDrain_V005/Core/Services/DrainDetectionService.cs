// UPDATED (V005), per Rafi's confirmed decisions on 2026-07-22 (second round):
//   1. Size filter (5-2000mm) REMOVED entirely — every opening loop that
//      survives dedup and shape classification becomes a DrainItem
//      regardless of its bounding-box dimensions.
//   2. Shape-edit vertex matching (X,Y -> Z) is DEFERRED — no longer run
//      during detection. DetectDrainsFromRoof now populates every DrainItem
//      with an EMPTY DrainVertices list; the grid can still show Shape/Size
//      immediately since those come from the loop's own geometry, not from
//      vertex matching. FindShapeVerticesAtLoopPoints is now PUBLIC so
//      AutoSlopeDrainEngine can call it later, at Run time, only for the
//      DrainItems the user actually selected — see that file for where the
//      matching now happens.
//
// Original rewrite (V005, first round): detection comes from the roof's
// Sketch profile (FootPrintRoof only), not raw solid/face geometry — ported
// from Revit26_Plugin.RoofTools.LineAndPoints.RoofRidgeLines.V67's
// InnerLoopService + OpeningAnalyzerService, adapted to still produce
// DrainItem so every downstream consumer (RoofSlopeProcessorService, the
// ViewModel grid, Excel export, parameter writer) is untouched.
//
// Current flow:
//   1. Read the roof's dependent Sketch. Compute each profile loop's area
//      (Shoelace); largest = outer boundary (discarded), rest = opening
//      candidates.
//   2. Tessellate each candidate loop to a flattened (Z=0) XYZ point list.
//   3. DEDUPLICATE THE LOOPS THEMSELVES by centroid proximity — happens
//      BEFORE classification, not as a cleanup pass at the end.
//   4. Classify each surviving unique loop: Circle (loop's real Arc/Ellipse
//      curves share a common center/radius — checked on the ORIGINAL curves,
//      not tessellated point count; see ClassifyShape/TryArcBasedCircle for
//      why point-count-based detection was unreliable for small circles),
//      Rectangle (4 tessellated vertices, adjacent edges perpendicular), else
//      Other/Polygon. Centroid (used only by the tessellated-point fallback
//      circle test) = bounding-box center.
//   5. Build a DrainItem with EMPTY DrainVertices — vertex matching deferred
//      to Run time (see AutoSlopeDrainEngine).
//
// REMOVED: the old raw-geometry path (GetUpwardFaces / DrainsFromFaceLoops /
// ProjectToFace / TryArcClusterCircle / TryBestFitCircle) — no longer used,
// since detection is Sketch-first only now. FootPrintRoof-without-a-sketch
// or non-FootPrintRoof cases are excluded at the Command's RoofFilter level
// (roof picker only allows FootPrintRoof), so there is no "no sketch found"
// fallback path to support here.
//
// UNCHANGED: GenerateSizeCategories / FilterDrainsBySize / FindVerticesForDrain
// (operate on DrainItem post-detection, no dependency on how detection works).
