// Changes vs ByPoint V018 / ByDrain V004:
//   REMOVED  IncludeVertexDetails — in ByPoint this flag actually did two
//            things: (1) gated whether skipped vertices were added to the
//            Vertex Data sheet, and (2) triggered a SECOND, duplicate
//            Excel export call (ExportDetailedVertexData) that wrote an
//            identical file under a second filename, logged with a stale
//            "Sheets: Summary, Drain Points, Vertices, Statistics" message
//            describing sheets that were never actually created. This was
//            a bug, not intentional behavior — confirmed with Rafi and
//            removed. The combined tool always includes skipped vertices
//            in the single Vertex Data sheet and makes exactly one export
//            call. See AutoSlopeDrainEngine / ExcelExportHelper.
//   REMOVED  ExportToCsv, FileNamePrefix pattern from ByDrain V004 — export
//            is Excel-only per Rafi's confirmed decision (2026-07-21).
//   KEPT     ExportPath, IncludeTimestamp — same meaning as both prior tools.
