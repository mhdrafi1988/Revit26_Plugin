// File: RoofBoundaryHelper.cs
// Location: Core/Engine/
// Base: GetBoundaryArcs ported unchanged from AutoSlopeByDrain V004 (itself
// ported from AutoSlopeByPoint's AutoSlopeGeometry.GetBoundaryArcs).
//
// NEW (V005): GetBoundaryLines added, ported from AutoSlopeByPoint's
// AutoSlopeGeometry.GetBoundaryLines. This was missing in V004 because
// CurveIntersectionHelper.InsertIntersectionPoints (which needs it) was
// present as a file but never actually called — the curve-intersection
// feature is being wired in for the first time in this combined tool, per
// Rafi's confirmed decision.
