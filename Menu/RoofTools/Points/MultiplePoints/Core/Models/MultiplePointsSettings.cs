// Global point-placement rule, shared by every edge — three independent
// checkboxes (per the user's explicit request: midpoint, quarter points,
// and extra points on long edges each toggle separately) plus the
// length threshold that gates the third checkbox.
// LimitMaxSlope/MaxSlopePercent is a display filter, not a re-extraction
// trigger — EdgePointService always extracts every perimeter edge
// regardless of its facet's slope; the ViewModel just hides edges whose
// FacetSlopePercent exceeds this cap when the checkbox is on, so toggling
// it never needs to touch the Revit API again.
