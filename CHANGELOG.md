# Changelog

All notable changes to SloperPro. Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).

- **Plugin version** lives in `Revit26_Plugin.csproj` (`<Version>`).
- **Tool versions** live in `Shared/Services/ToolCatalog.cs`. Each tool has its own semantic version;
  the ribbon tooltip, the tool's window title and its error dialogs all read it from there.

Each release lists every tool whose version changed, under the plugin version.

## [3.0.0] — 2026-10-08

### Removed
- **Ribbon: every tool now lists only its latest two versions.** Buttons removed from the dropdowns:
  Elevation Sync V003, Edge Element V002, Roof View Focus V002, Scope Box V004, Sheet Placer V222,
  Rearrange V025 / V026, From Links VA006 / VA007 / VA008, Schedule I/O V003 / V004 / V005,
  DWG To DL(P) V011 / V012, By Drain V007.
- **Source folders of superseded versions deleted from the repository** (still in git history), including
  older versions that were already off the ribbon: Detail Line Closed Loop V001, Auto Dim Detail Line V008,
  Floors And Roof From Linked Rooms V011, Via Plan View V004, Annotation Overlap Detection V002,
  ParaManager V003, Workset Renamer V003 / FX03, Workset Manager V012, Worksets & Elements Browser WSEB002,
  Combined Roof Tools V001, Roof Point Comparison V001, Roof Point Elevation Sync V003,
  Ridge By Openings V068, Ridge By Points V057, Multiple Points V001, Roof Edge Vertex Reducer V007,
  Roof Detail Line Intersect V012, Roof From Detail Lines V007, Auto Slope By Point V028 /
  Multi Copies 28 / Ridge V001, Multi-Roof Slope By Drain V010, Roof Type Creator V001, DWG To Lines V005,
  DWG To Detail Lines V011 / V012, Automated Section Placer V001, Plan From Scope Box V004,
  Smart View To Sheet Placer V222, Sheet Auto Rearrange V026, Roof Tag V016, Create Sections V011,
  Roof Edge Around Sections V005, Roof Edge Element Sections V002, Roof View Focus V002,
  Section View Auto Tagger V004, Auto Place Sections V322, Callout To Section V019,
  Reference Section Head Placer V013, Bubble Auto Renumber V006, Section Auto Renamer V024,
  View Auto Renamer V004.
- Kept on disk but **not on the ribbon**: Auto Slope By Drain V007, Creaser Adv V010, Divide Inner Loops V009,
  Inner Loops And Perpendicular V005 and Outer Curve Divider V004. Combined Roof Tools V002 / V003 are built
  on these versions and stop compiling without them. They go when Combined Roof Tools moves to the
  current tool versions.

### Fixed
- **Detail Lines From Links VA010** — its button did nothing: the command class was never added when
  VA010 was introduced on 2026-10-04. The command now exists (same entry checks as VA009, run through
  `ToolGuard`), so VA010 and VA009 both open.

**User note:** Revit ties keyboard shortcuts and Quick Access Toolbar items to a button. Re-assign any you
had on the removed buttons above. The remaining buttons keep their internal names, command classes and
shortcuts. This is a MAJOR release because versions were removed (same as 2.0.0); if you still need one,
it can be restored from git history.

## [2.5.0] — 2026-10-08

### Added
- **DWG To DL(P) V014 (tool 14.0.0)** — new version of the DWG to detail lines tool, with a
  line style / hatch mapping choice:
  - **Single (global):** one global line style and one global hatch apply to every selected layer.
  - **Multiple (per layer):** each layer row has its own line style (lines) or hatch type (hatches);
    rows you don't touch follow the global values. "Apply global to all rows" resets them.
  - The mode, the global picks and per-layer picks are remembered per CAD layer name
    (`%AppData%\Revit26_Plugin\DwgToDlp\mapping.json`, versioned).

  - The "missing line style / hatch type" prompt now also offers **Create all remaining** and
    **Skip all remaining**, so a DWG with many new layers needs one click, not one per layer.
  - A real **progress bar** in the status strip while converting: percent, current layer and
    element count (lines first, then hatches), and a "Done: N placed..." summary at the end.

### Changed
- The **Detail Lines** pulldown in Project Tools is now **DWG To DL(P)**, and its items are labelled
  "DWG To DL(P) V0xx". V014 is listed first; V013, V012 and V011 stay below it. User note: button
  internal names are unchanged, so existing customisations keep working.
- V014 runs through `ToolGuard`, so unexpected errors are logged to `%AppData%\Revit26_Plugin\Logs`.

### Notes
- The global and per-layer dropdowns start on **(Match layer name)**, which is exactly the V013
  behaviour (use the style named after the layer, ask before creating a missing one), so V014
  behaves like V013 until you choose something else.

## [2.4.0] — 2026-10-08

### Changed
- **Ribbon: 17 panels → 13, every button shows its name.** Revit hides button names (and then
  whole panels) when the tab is wider than the window, starting from the right, which left the
  Manage panel icon-only. The tab is now narrower:
  - **Floor Tools** → merged into **Roof Tools** (as "Floor From Rooms").
  - **Sheet Place** → merged into **Sheet Create** (Rearrange, Arrange Views).
  - **Detail Line Create**, **Detail Line Process** and **Dimensions** → one new **Detail Lines**
    panel (From Links, Closed Loop, Line Dims).
  - View Create and View Place no longer end in a large single button: 4 tools stack as 2 + 2
    (`RibbonLayoutHelper.AddStackedButtons`: 4 → 2+2, 5 → 3+2, 7 → 3+2+2).
  - Shorter labels: Combined Roof Tools → Combined Tools, Roof Type Manager → Roof Types,
    Roof From Detail Lines → Roof From Lines, Sections From Lines → From Lines, Section Around
    Edges → Around Edges, Roof View Focus → Roof Focus, Section Head Placer → Head Placer,
    Section View Tagger → View Tagger, Auto Section Placer → Section Placer, Detail Line Closed
    Loop → Closed Loop, Overlap Detection → Overlaps, Worksets & Elements → WS Browser,
    Workset Manager → WS Manager, Workset Renamer → WS Renamer, Workset Renamer (Excel) →
    WS Renamer XL, Delete Line Styles → Del. Line Styles, Schedule Export/Import → Schedule I/O.
  - Internal button names, command classes, versions and tooltips are unchanged.

**User note:** Revit ties keyboard shortcuts and Quick Access Toolbar items to the panel a button
is in. These six buttons changed panel, so re-assign any shortcut or QAT entry you had on them:
Floor From Rooms, Rearrange, Arrange Views, From Links, Closed Loop, Line Dims (was Dimensions →
Detail Lines). All other buttons keep their shortcuts. On a narrow screen or with Windows display
scaling above 100 %, Revit may still hide some names.
## [2.3.4] — 2026-10-08

### Fixed
- **Delete Line Styles v1.0.2 (V001)** — every run failed with "Category is unexpectedly NULL"
  and rolled back, so no line style was ever deleted. The tool read a line style's name after
  deleting it; it now reads everything it needs first and looks each style up fresh. No other
  behaviour change.

## [2.3.3] — 2026-10-08

### Changed
- **Ribbon dropdowns** — every pulldown that lists coexisting versions of a tool (Manage, Roof
  Tools, View Tools, Sheet Tools, Setup, Dimensions, Detail Lines, Floor Tools panels) now lists
  the highest version number first, with every older version below it in descending order. Several
  pulldowns previously listed the "current" version first and a newer rebuild further down (e.g.
  Schedule Export/Import showed V005, V006, V007, V004, V003); they now read highest-to-lowest.
  The pulldown button's own icon is always the highest version's icon.

**User note:** only the dropdown order changed — no button's internal name, command class, or
behaviour changed, and the ribbon button face still shows only the tool name, never a version
number.

## [2.3.2] — 2026-10-08

### Changed
- **Delete Line Styles v1.0.1 (V001)** — has its own ribbon icon (line styles with a red delete
  badge) instead of the Detail Lines icon. No behaviour change.

## [2.3.1] — 2026-10-08

### Fixed
- **Delete Workset v1.0.3 (V001)** — the run failed with "The file-based central model could not
  be reached" whenever central was offline or its path was not reachable from this PC (unmapped
  drive, VPN down, detached or copied model). The tool now deletes the selected worksets you
  already own and skips the rest, with a log line for each, instead of aborting the whole run.

**User note:** when central is unreachable, only worksets already checked out to you (or all
worksets in a detached model) can be deleted. Reconnect and Synchronize with Central to delete
the others.

## [2.3.0] — 2026-10-07

### Added
- **Delete Line Styles v1.0.0 (V001)** — new tool on the Manage panel. Lists every custom line
  style with how many lines use it (model, detail, symbolic and sketch lines, including lines in
  groups and filled-region boundaries). Two modes:
  - **Unused line styles only** (default) — deletes styles no line uses.
  - **All custom line styles** — also deletes used styles; their lines are changed to a
    replacement style you choose (default `<Thin Lines>`) before the style is deleted.

  Revit's built-in line styles are never touched. Styles owned by another user, or whose lines
  are owned by other users, are shown as "Blocked" and skipped. A style is skipped (and left
  unchanged) if any of its lines cannot take the replacement style. Everything runs in one
  transaction, so Ctrl+Z undoes the whole run.

**User note:** edges overridden with the Linework tool cannot be read through the Revit API, so a
style used only there counts as unused; those edges revert to their default style if it is deleted.

## [2.2.2] — 2026-10-07

### Fixed
- **Delete Workset v1.0.2 (V001)** — no workset could ever be selected. The tool treated every
  workset you had not already checked out as "Built-in", and then blocked the one you did own as
  "the only editable workset". Now every user workset is deletable unless another user has it
  checked out ("In use"), some of its elements are owned by other users ("Blocked"), or it is the
  only user workset. The badge tooltip gives the reason.
- Selected worksets are checked out from central automatically when you press Delete Workset;
  any that cannot be checked out are skipped and logged. Revit's own `CanDeleteWorkset` check runs
  before each deletion.
- "Migrate elements to" now lists every workset not being deleted (it only offered "deletable"
  ones). A target is required when a selected workset has elements or is closed; an empty open
  workset can be deleted without one (it used to fail).
- Answering **No** to a per-workset confirmation now skips just that workset instead of rolling
  back the whole run.
- Toolbar buttons (Select All / Clear / Refresh) and "Closed" status pills were unreadable
  (white text on a light background).

**User note:** running the tool now checks the selected worksets out to you in central.
Synchronize with Central afterwards to publish the deletion and release them.

## [2.2.1] — 2026-10-07

### Fixed
- **Delete Workset v1.0.1 (V001)** — the tool crashed on open with "'Border' TargetType does not
  match type of element 'TextBlock'". The metric-strip labels used a tile (Border) style and the
  options separator used a Border style on a `Separator`; both now use the correct styles. No
  behaviour change.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-10-07

### Added
- **Sheet View Arrange v1.0.0 (V001)** — new tool in the Sheet Place panel ("Arrange Views").
  Re-orders the views already on the active sheet by their existing Detail Number (natural
  order: 1, 2, 10 … A1, A2, B1) and lays them out like a reading table: left → right, wrapping
  into rows top → bottom. Each row is spread across the full usable width, rows are spread to
  the full usable height, and views in a row share a bottom line so their titles align. The last
  row can be packed left (default), justified or centred. Views are only moved — never resized,
  rescaled or removed. Usable area = title block inset by margins; live to-scale preview; nothing
  moves if the views don't fit, and Apply is refused if the sheet changed after the preview.
  Pinned views are moved and re-pinned (option); views owned by another user or changed in
  central (Reload Latest needed) are skipped and reported. One Undo step. Settings saved in
  `%AppData%\Revit26_Plugin\SheetViewArrange\settings.json`.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-10-06

### Added
- **Delete Workset v1.0.0 (V001)** — new Manage tool. Select one or more user worksets from a
  data grid (non-deletable built-ins and the last remaining workset are shown greyed out), choose a
  migration target workset, and delete them in a single transaction group. Migratable elements are
  reassigned; view-specific and read-only-partition elements can optionally be hard-deleted. The
  real-time log panel shows per-step progress and a completion summary. Ribbon button added to the
  Manage panel.
- **Export DWG to Folder v1.0.0** — new tool in the Setup › Project Tools panel.
  Scans the active document for all embedded CAD links (`IsLinked = true`) and CAD
  imports, classifies each by source type (link / import) and view category
  (plan / section / drafting / no_views), and exports them to a user-selected folder.
  Linked DWGs are copied directly from their source path; imported DWGs are exported
  from their host view via `Document.Export`.  Optional sidecar `.txt` file per DWG
  records View Name, Associated Sheet, Element ID and Symbol Name.  Options: toggle
  linked / imported sources, per-view-type subfolder checkboxes, sidecar toggle,
  overwrite toggle.  Settings are persisted in
  `%AppData%\Revit26_Plugin\ExportDwgToFolder\settings.json`.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-10-02

### Removed
- Superseded tool versions and their ribbon buttons (only the newest of each tool is kept):
  Detail Lines From Links VA003/VA006, Schedule Export/Import V001–V003, Plan From Scope Box V003,
  Smart View To Sheet Placer V221, Sheet Auto Rearrange V024/V025, DWG To Detail Lines V002,
  Roof Edge Element Sections V001, Roof View Focus V001, Roof Point Elevation Sync V002,
  and the unused WSFL V011 workset tool.
- All `.zip` backup copies from the repository (still in git history).

### Changed
- Ribbon: a button with a single tool now runs it on click, and is no longer a one-item dropdown.
  Dropdowns remain only where they group different tools (By Point, By Drain, Ridge Lines, From Rooms).
- Ribbon labels show the tool name only; the version moved to the tooltip
  ("Name — vX.Y.Z (build Vnnn)"). Internal button names and command classes are unchanged.
- Tools moved from build tags to semantic versions. Starting version = build number
  (e.g. build V004 → 4.0.0); see the table below.

### Added
- Suite-wide error safety net (`ToolGuard`): every command and external-event handler is guarded,
  and unhandled errors from tool windows are caught, so a tool error no longer reaches or crashes Revit.
  Errors are shown in a dialog and written to `%AppData%\Revit26_Plugin\Logs\errors-YYYY-MM-DD.log`.
- Each tool window's title ends with its version, e.g. "Sheet Auto Rearrange — v26.0.0".

### User notes
- Old tool versions are gone from the ribbon. If you relied on one, tell the maintainer before upgrading.
- A failing tool now shows an error dialog naming the tool and the log file — send that log when
  reporting a problem.
- Revit keyboard shortcuts must be reassigned for removed versions and for the 11 tools that moved out
  of a one-item dropdown (Revit keys shortcuts by the button's ribbon path). Other buttons keep theirs.
